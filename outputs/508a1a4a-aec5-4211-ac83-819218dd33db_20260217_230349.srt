00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Life moves fast, and it sees it a feel like we're always chasing something success, approval, or the next big goal.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But sometimes, the most powerful thing you can do is pause. Take a breath. Notice where you are right now.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Every small step you take matters, even the ones that feel insignificant. Progress is not always loud or dramatic.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Often, it's quiet, steady, and built on consistency. Remember, you don't have to have everything figured out today. Learn a little.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Grow a little. Be kind to yourself along the way. Your journey is your own, and comparison only steals joy.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Focus on becoming a better version of yourself than you were yesterday.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
One step. One moment. One better time. That's how meaningful change happens.
